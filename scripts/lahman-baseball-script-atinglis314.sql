-- QUESTION 1: What range of years for baseball games played does the provided database cover?
SELECT yearID

--ANSWER: 145 years: 1871 - 2016





-- QUESTION 2: Find the name and height of the shortest player in the database. How many games did he play in? What is the name of the team for which he played?
-- I need to look at the g_all column to understand something:
SELECT *
FROM appearances

--can I find the team name in the teams table?
SELECT *

-- What about players who played for multiple teams?...
SELECT playerid, count(teamid)

--loesbi01 played for 12 teams, let's look at that
SELECT *

--JUST KIDDING I DIDN'T ACCOUNT FOR DUPLICATES take 2
SELECT playerid, COUNT(DISTINCT teamid)

--aardsda01 played for 8 teams, let's look at that
SELECT *

--so g_all is total games played in a given year. mmmmmkay. let's try this.

--wait... let me double-check the total appearances for this guy, because it said 1 in the query without the team name and 52 in the query with...
SELECT *
FROM appearances
WHERE playerid = 'gaedeed01';

--that's whack. maybe the join type is the issue? Or I can try adding a where subquery to only pull the shortest guy?
SELECT p.playerID, p.nameFIRST, p.nameLAST, p.nameGIVEN, p.height, sum(a.g_all) AS total_appearances, a.teamid, t.name, count(a.teamid) AS team_count

--this won't solve my problem, but... let's see how many appearances the team has in total
SELECT teamID, sum(g_all)
FROM appearances
WHERE teamID = 'SLA'
GROUP BY teamID;

--ANSWER: Eddie Gaedel (Edward Carl Gaedel) was the shortest player in the database at 43 inches tall. He played in one total game, for the St. Louis Browns. I can't get my query to work, but I'm gonna put a pin in it and come back.





--QUESTION 3: Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University. Create a list showing each playerâ€™s first and last names as well as the total salary they earned in the major leagues. Sort this list in descending order by the total salary earned. Which Vanderbilt player earned the most money in the majors?
--what's the difference between the schools table and the college table?
SELECT *

--note to self: schools is just data about each school, collegeplaying is where each player played in college, as well as when they played.

--what is vanderbilt's schoolid?

--QUESTION 4: Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.
SELECT * 
FROM fielding;

--ok, let's take a stab at it... current plan is to select

--the categories are all coming out as Battery............................... but when I run the CTE as its own query, it doesn't................... what the HECK.

--try it without a CTE, and without the window statement
SELECT f.playerid, f.pos,

--this query doesn't work because the case statement is creating a column that I want to partition by, but I can't because of order of operations... hmm ok. back to the drawing board

--ANSWER: both metrics had an increasing trend on average, with some decades having significant jumps (1930s in SO, 1960s in SO, 1950s in HR, 2000s in HR) and both trends had a period of slight decline as well. A linear trendline would still have a positive slope in both categories

--QUESTION 7: From 1970 â€“ 2016, what is the largest number of wins for a team that did not win the world series? What is the smallest number of wins for a team that did win the world series? Doing this will probably result in an unusually small number of wins for a world series champion â€“ determine why this is the case. Then redo your query, excluding the problem year. How often from 1970 â€“ 2016 was it the case that a team with the most wins also won the world series? What percentage of the time?
